A [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) integration for [Graphene](http://graphene-python.org/).

## Installation

For instaling graphene, just run this command in your shell

```bash
pip install "graphene-django>=1.0"
```

### Settings

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    # ...
    'graphene_django',
)

GRAPHENE = {
    'SCHEMA': 'app.schema.schema' # Where your Graphene schema lives
}
```

### Urls

We need to set up a `GraphQL` endpoint in our Django app, so we can serve the queries.

```python
from django.conf.urls import url
from graphene_django.views import GraphQLView

urlpatterns = [
    # ...
    url(r'^graphql', GraphQLView.as_view(graphiql=True)),
]
```

## Examples

Here is a simple Django model:

```python
from django.db import models

class UserModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
```

To create a GraphQL schema for it you simply have to write the following:

```python
from graphene_django import DjangoObjectType
import graphene

class User(DjangoObjectType):
    class Meta:
        model = UserModel

class Query(graphene.ObjectType):
    users = graphene.List(User)

    @graphene.resolve_only_args
    def resolve_users(self):
        return UserModel.objects.all()

schema = graphene.Schema(query=Query)
```

Then you can simply query the schema:

```python
query = '''
    query {
      users {
        name,
        lastName
      }
    }
'''
result = schema.execute(query)
```
