Graphene-Django
===============

Welcome to the Graphene-Django docs.

Graphene-Django is built on top of `Graphene <https://docs.graphene-python.org/en/latest/>`__.
Graphene-Django provides some additional abstractions that make it easy to add GraphQL functionality to your Django project.

First time? We recommend you start with the installation guide to get set up and the basic tutorial.
It is worth reading the `core graphene docs <https://docs.graphene-python.org/en/latest/>`__ to familiarize yourself with the basic utilities.

Core tenets
-----------

If you want to expose your data through GraphQL - read the ``Installation``, ``Schema`` and ``Queries`` section.
